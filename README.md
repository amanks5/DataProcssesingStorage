To improve this assignment, I would clarify the grading criteria a little, outlining the specific expectations and how each aspect of the assignment will be evaluated. I would expand the assignment a little, by adding requirements such as implementing concurrency control so students could learn a little bit more about the assingment itself. I would provide a comprehensive set of test cases to help students validate their implementations itself, so the result or output could be a bit more streamlined.. Finally, I would offer more detailed instructions, especially for beginners, to guide them through the process.
